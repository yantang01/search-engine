A web crawler and a search engine built by Python.

## Steps to run:

- clone repo
- call the crawl function in the crawler.py and pass a website
- call the search function in the search.py. The first parameter is your search query, and the second parameter is a boolean value whether you want to boost your result by only showing top-quality content
- cd search-engine
- python3 crawler.py
- python3 search.py

You only have to run crawler.py once for each website and be able to search unlimited times.

## Enhancement:

Applied OOP principles and re-designed Search Engine 2.0 with a GUI using Java and JavaFX
